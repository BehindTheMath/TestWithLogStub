# Test With Log Stub
This is a class that stubs out `android.util.Log` for unit testing, using [PowerMock](<https://github.com/powermock/powermock>) and [Mockito](<http://site.mockito.org/>). All `Log.*` methods are redirected to `System.out.println()`, so the output shows in the JUnit console. This allows easy unit testing of code with calls to `Log.*`, without requiring extensive modification to implement dependency injection, while still showing the output in the console.

## Usage
1. Copy `TestWithLogStub.java` to your project, and rename the package name to match your package.
2. Make sure you have the following lines in the `dependencies` block in your module-level `build.gradle`:
```java
    testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'
    testCompile 'org.mockito:mockito-core:1.10.19'
    testCompile 'org.powermock:powermock-api-mockito:1.6.6'
    testCompile 'org.powermock:powermock-module-junit4:1.6.6'
```
3. Subclass the TestWithLogMock class, and add your own methods. Call `Log.*` as usual, and the output will be redirected to the console.

**Example:**
```java
package io.behindthemath.test;

import android.util.Log;

import org.junit.Test;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class TestClass extends TestWithLogMock{
    @Test
    public void test() {
        Log.i("TestClass", "This is a test");

        assertEquals(true, true);
    }
}

```
**Output:**
`I/TestClass: This is a test`
